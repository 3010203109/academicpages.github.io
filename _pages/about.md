I am currently an associate professor at the School of Future Technology (Institute of Artificial Intelligence), Shanghai University. I received my B.S. and Ph.D. degrees from Tianjin University in Control Science and Engineering in 2014 and 2019, respectively. 
From 2016 to 2017, I was a Visiting Scholar at the State University of New York at Buffalo. From 2017 to 2018, I was a Visiting Scientist at Cornell University. From 2019 to 2022, I was a Postdoc at Tsinghua University. My research interests include legged robots, reinforcement learning, and embodied AI.
